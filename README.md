# Mutation-Event
In this project we explore two event listeners each trigget their own function. 
The first is on the last but one line, and it listens for when the user clicks the link to add a new list item. It then uses DOM manipulation events to add a new element
their own function. 

The first is on the last but one line, and it listens for when the user clicks the link to add a new list item. It then uses DOM manipulation events to add a new element (changing the DOM structure and triggering mutation events).

The second event listener waits for the DOM tree within the tree element to change. When the event fires, it calls a function called updateCount ().This function counts how many items there are in the list, and then updates the list count at the top of the page accordingly.
